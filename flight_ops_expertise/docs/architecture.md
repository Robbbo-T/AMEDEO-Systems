            d_model=512,
            n_heads=8,
            n_layers=12,
            max_seq_len=1000
        )
        self.tcn = TemporalConvNet(
            input_channels=512,
            n_channels=[256, 128, 64],

            "fuel_reserve": 0.05     # 5% minimum
        }
        
    def learn_policy(self, dataset):
        # Conservative Q-Learning with safety penalties
        for batch in dataset:
            q_values = self.q_network(batch.states)
            
            # Apply safety constraints
            safe_actions = self.filter_safe_actions(
                batch.actions, 
                self.safety_constraints
            )
            
            # CQL loss with conservative penalty
            loss = self.cql_loss(q_values, safe_actions, batch.rewards)
            
            self.optimizer.step(loss)
```

        # SHAP for feature importance
        explainer = shap.TreeExplainer(model)
        shap_values = explainer.shap_values(data)
        
        # Frequent pattern mining
        patterns = self.fp_growth(
            data,
            min_support=0.01,
            min_confidence=0.8
        )
        
        # Rule extraction
        rules = []
        for pattern in patterns:
            rule = self.pattern_to_rule(pattern)
            
            # Validate rule
            uplift = self.backtest_rule(rule, historical_data)
            if uplift >= 0.015:  # 1.5% threshold
                rules.append(rule)
