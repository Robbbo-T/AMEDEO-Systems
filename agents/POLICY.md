# AMEDEO Agent Governance Policy

**Document ID**: AQUART-AGT-DOC-POLICY-agent_governance-v1.0  
**Classification**: Internal Use  
**Effective Date**: 2024  

## Purpose

This document establishes the governance framework for AMEDEO (Aerospace Main Evolution Digital Ecosystem Operations) autonomous agents operating within aerospace mission-critical environments.

## Agent Types and Responsibilities

### Strategic Planner Agent
- **Role**: Decision horizon transformation and portfolio architecture
- **Depth Requirement**: ≥3.0x productivity improvement per execution
- **Authority**: Strategic planning, resource allocation decisions
- **Safety Constraints**: Must maintain strategic coherence across planning horizons

### Supply Buyer Agent  
- **Role**: Supply chain optimization and procurement rhythm management
- **Depth Requirement**: ≥3.0x productivity improvement per execution
- **Authority**: Supplier selection, lead time optimization
- **Safety Constraints**: Must ensure supply chain resilience and regulatory compliance

### Resource Scheduler Agent
- **Role**: Capacity planning and elastic resource allocation
- **Depth Requirement**: ≥3.0x productivity improvement per execution  
- **Authority**: Resource allocation, capacity scaling decisions
- **Safety Constraints**: Must maintain system stability during scaling operations

### Ops Pilot Agent
- **Role**: Operational envelope expansion and mission parameter optimization
- **Depth Requirement**: ≥3.0x productivity improvement per execution
- **Authority**: Real-time operational adjustments within approved envelopes
- **Safety Constraints**: Must operate within certified flight envelopes

## Governance Principles

1. **Depth Gate Enforcement**: All agent actions must demonstrate ≥3.0x productivity improvement or be explicitly rejected
2. **Cascade Multiplication**: System-wide impact must achieve ≥81x improvement (3^4 minimum cascade)
3. **Deterministic Execution**: All operations must be reproducible and traceable
4. **Evidence Generation**: All executions must generate cryptographically signed evidence bundles
5. **Fail-Safe Operation**: Agents must gracefully degrade to human oversight when unable to meet depth requirements

## Compliance Requirements

- **UTCS-MI v5.0+**: 100% compliance with Universal Traceability and Control System
- **Coverage**: ≥92% test coverage for all agent code
- **Security**: All HIGH severity vulnerabilities must be resolved
- **Signatures**: All artifacts must be cryptographically signed with post-quantum algorithms

## Monitoring and Auditing

All agent activities are subject to continuous monitoring and must provide real-time telemetry for:
- Productivity impact measurements  
- Safety constraint validation
- Resource utilization metrics
- Decision audit trails

## Emergency Procedures

In case of agent failure to meet depth requirements or safety constraints:
1. Immediate escalation to human oversight
2. Evidence preservation and analysis
3. Root cause analysis and corrective action
4. Re-certification before resuming autonomous operation
